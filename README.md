# the-lab
A collection of experiments for exploring, building, learning &amp; hacking all built with the Web Technologies

## ABOUT

Coding is for everyone. I wanted to explore and learn new technologies and make my experimentation a bit more accessible to everyone. This lab is a set of experiments that let anyone, explore projects, all built with the Web Technologies.

I'm sharing open-source code here so that others can build new experiments based on what I've started. The experiments were developed by different designers and coders, so they use a variety of libraries and techniques such:
- PHP: Laravel, Symfony, Drupal
- Javascript: ES6/ES2015, NodeJS, ExpressJS, ThreeJS, AngularJS, GulpJS, Babel
- Markup: HTML, HTML5
- Style: CSS, CSS3, SaSS, Compass
- and much more. 

I hope they're useful as inspiration or reference for anyone who wants to create their projects on the web.

Consult the README in each experiment's folder for more information on building and running that experiment.
